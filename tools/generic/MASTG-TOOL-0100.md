The [re-flutter](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter) framework helps to reverse engineer Flutter apps using the patched version of the Flutter library, which is already compiled and ready for application repackaging. This library has a modified snapshot deserialization process that allows you to perform dynamic analysis.

You can install and use re-flutter by following [the official instructions](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter?tab=readme-ov-file#install).
